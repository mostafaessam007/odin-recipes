<p>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is a simple yet flavorful Italian pasta dish that highlights the beauty of minimal ingredients. It features al dente spaghetti tossed in a fragrant blend of sautéed garlic and red pepper flakes in olive oil.

    The dish is finished with a sprinkle of freshly chopped parsley and a generous grating of Parmesan cheese, adding a touch of color and richness. The garlic is cooked until golden, infusing the oil with a rich, savory flavor, while the red pepper flakes provide a gentle heat.

It's quick to prepare, making it a favorite for weeknight dinners or a last-minute gathering with friends. Serve it with a side of crusty bread to soak up the delicious oil!
