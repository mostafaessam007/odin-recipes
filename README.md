So this is my first ever HTML project , Today's date is October 7th 2024 , i'm writing this down so i can look back on it in a couple of years and so how much i have gotten better or even if i'm still coding , who knows.

My first project is going to be about Recipes!
What i'm going to apply here is using : lists , images , links , pages , headings , paragraphs , etc .
